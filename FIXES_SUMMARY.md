## Performance Improvements

1. **Caching Strategy**: Menu items are now cached in sessionStorage for 5 minutes
2. **Error Recovery**: Fallback to expired cache if API fails

4. **Mobile Optimization**: Improved touch targets and responsive design

## Technical Details

### Menu Caching
- Cache key: `menuItems` in sessionStorage
- Cache duration: 5 minutes
- Fallback: Uses expired cache if API fails

### Cart Image Restoration
- Images are restored by fetching menu data and matching cart items
- Only essential data is stored in localStorage
- Images are re-fetched on cart load to ensure freshness

### Mobile Button Fix
- Remove button: 32px × 32px on mobile, 36px × 36px on desktop
- Proper circular shape with `border-radius: 50%`
- Enhanced hover and active states
- Better touch area for accessibility
