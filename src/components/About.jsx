            <p className="about-story">
              Founded in 2018 by Fernando Gonzalez, our food truck brings the authentic 
              flavors of Guadalajara to your neighborhood. Fernando learned these recipes 
              from his grandmother, who ran a small taqueria in Mexico for over 40 years.
            </p>
            <p className="about-story">
              Every dish is prepared with the same love and attention to detail that has 
              been passed down through generations. We use only the freshest ingredients 
              and traditional cooking methods to ensure every bite transports you to Mexico.
