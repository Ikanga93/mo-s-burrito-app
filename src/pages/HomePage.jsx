                <p>Always genuinely amazing food. Tortas are the best I've ever had. I think they pan fry the bread with cheese to get this really crispy, savory cheese layer on it. It's so good. Employees are always super nice and efficient too. Best prices in town as well. 11/10 I've brought every friend who's visited me to this truck.</p>

                <p>Holy moly these are some good tacos. And so reasonably priced!!!! The chorizo especially was unreal, but the pastor was bomb and the asada was solid too! Will definitely come back if I'm in Champaign again.</p>

                <p>These are the best tacos I've tried in the US. The al pastor tacos are my favorite! And the burritos are great too. I would highly recommend Mo's Burritos!</p>

                <p>One of the best quick Mexican food places in Urbana Champaign. I tried almost all Mexican restaurants in this area, and usually I have tons of nachos remaining when the topping is gone. But here, the topping portion is a lot so I finish topping and nachos at the same time! I recommend avocado topping addition if you like avocado. Their tacos are amazing too. It is worth it.</p>

                <p>As someone who grew up in Mexico, I have to say these are the best tacos in Champaign. They taste as good as any street taco you can get in Mexico. Also, the staff always greets you with a smile and makes you feel like a valued customer. Can't recommend this place enough.</p>
